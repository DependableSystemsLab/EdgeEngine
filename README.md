# EdgeEngine

This repository contains the code and data used in the research paper titled "EdgeEngine: A Thermal-Aware Optimization Framework for Edge Inference." This study aims to introduce a thermal-aware optimization framework for heterogenous edge devices to find the near-optimal frequency configurations (CPU, GPU, Memory controller) at different ambient temperatures. EdgeEngine uses reinforcement learning for the purpose of the adaptation.
